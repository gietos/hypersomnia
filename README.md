# Hypersomnia

Hypersomnia is a duct tape web tool to debug your microservice RPC endpoints.

## Install
```
go get -u github.com/gietos/hypersomnia
```

## Usage

Default registry is mdns, if your microservices use it, you can simply start with:
```
hypersomnia
```

If default port 8083 is used by some other application, or if you don't want to bind on public interface you can use different setting of your choice:
```
HYPERSOMNIA_ADDR=127.0.0.1:31337 hypersomnia
```

To use consul registry:
```
HYPERSOMNIA_REGISTRY=consul hypersomnia
```
